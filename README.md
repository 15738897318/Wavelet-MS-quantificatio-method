# Wavelet-based-MS-quantificatio-methodn
A novel and concise algorithm for MS data peak detection and especially peak quantification by utilize 2-D Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) coefficients matrix information, which derived from applying CWT over MS raw data. No further baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection.
